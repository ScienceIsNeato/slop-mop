# Contributing to Slop-Mop

Honestly, I'm not really sure what my plans are for this project long term? For now, I encourage contributions in the form of Pull Requests and also issue reports - glad to have like-minded company!

## Guidelines

- **Fork nicely.** If you fork this project, please attribute the original. A link back to [ScienceIsNeato/slop-mop](https://github.com/ScienceIsNeato/slop-mop) in your README is good enough.
- **Adding a new gate?** Follow the [New Gate Protocol](NEW_GATE_PROTOCOL.md) — it's a strict, step-by-step process that ensures nothing gets missed.
- **Self-validate.** Run `sm validate --self` before opening a PR. If the gates don't pass on slop-mop itself, the CI won't either.
