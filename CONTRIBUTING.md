## Guidelines

- **Fork responsibly.** If you fork this project, please attribute the original. A link back to [ScienceIsNeato/slop-mop](https://github.com/ScienceIsNeato/slop-mop) in your README is sufficient.

- **Self-validate.** Run `sm validate --self` before opening a PR. If the gates don't pass on slop-mop itself, the CI won't either.
