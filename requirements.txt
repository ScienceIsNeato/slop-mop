# Slop-Mop Dependencies
#
# ⚠️  pyproject.toml is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for dependencies.
# This file exists as a fallback for setup.sh if editable install fails,
# and as a human-readable summary. Keep it in sync with pyproject.toml.
#
# Install via: pip install -e .  (preferred)
#         or:  pip install -r requirements.txt  (fallback)
