# Prepare a release: bump version, create branch + PR.
#
# This is the CI wrapper for scripts/release.sh. It provides a
# GitHub Actions UI button to trigger releases with a paper trail.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Go to Actions → "Prepare Release" → Run workflow
#   2. Select bump type (patch/minor/major)
#   3. Workflow creates the release branch + PR
#   4. Review and merge the PR
#   5. Push the tag to trigger release.yml
