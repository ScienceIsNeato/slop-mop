# Publish to PyPI when a version tag is pushed.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Push a tag:  git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0
#   2. This workflow builds the package and uploads to PyPI
#   3. A GitHub Release is created with auto-generated notes
#
# Prerequisites (one-time setup):
#   - Create a PyPI account at https://pypi.org/account/register/
#   - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
#   - Add a "pending publisher":
#       Owner:      ScienceIsNeato
#       Repository: slop-mop
#       Workflow:   release.yml
#       Environment: pypi
#   - (Optional) Do the same on https://test.pypi.org for staging

# Prevent concurrent releases for the same tag, but never cancel an in-progress
# release — PyPI forbids re-uploading the same version, so a partial publish
# caused by cancellation would be permanently broken.
